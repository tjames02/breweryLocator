# Project 1 Application Proposals

1.	Traveling application that allows the user to view restaurants in their vicinity that has only 5-star reviews from Yelp. This would use the YELP API and a MAP API.
2.	We would like to create an application that helps people find events in the city they are in. This application would potentially use the Ticket Master API and a MAP (google, apple, etc.) API to help the user find directions. It could also use the Spotify API to play music by said event??
3.	A groupon app..
